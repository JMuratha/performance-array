# performance-array development

To set up the project you just have to execute the usual `npm install` .
After that you can run a single build with `npm run-script build`, or you can use the handy `npm run-script build --watch` command to make the build process automatically watch your changes and rebuild them automatically.

Tests are executed with a simple `npm test` command.
